# PNW Ski Conditions Site

Ever wake up on a pow day and scramble to make a decision on which mountain to ski at? Frantically checking across 5 different (slow) websites that hide their information across 3 different pages each? Then this is the site for you!

PNW Ski Conditions aims to make the decision process a breeze by providing only the important information to the user, in a neat table for whatever mountains they choose. Get information like snow precip, non-snow precip, average temperatures, etc. across multiple time frames. And links to each of the ski area's NOAA and NWAC avalanche forecasts are provided for easy access.
